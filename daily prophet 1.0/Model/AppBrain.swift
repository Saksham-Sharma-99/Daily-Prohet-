    var newsPaperQuotes = ["If you don't read the newspaper, you are uninformed. If you do read the newspaper, you are misinformed.","The newspaper is in all its literalness the bible of democracy, the book out of which a people determines its conduct.","Like the newspapers used to say, if the truth isn't big enough, you print the legend.","A newspaper is a device for making the ignorant more ignorant and the crazy crazier.","A good newspaper is never nearly good enough but a lousy newspaper is a joy forever.","Journalism is popular, but it is popular mainly as fiction. Life is one world, and life seen in the newspapers another.","Let me make the newspapers, and I care not what is preached in the pulpit or what is enacted in congress.","A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and a collective agitator, it is also a collective organiser.","The noiseless din that we have long known in dreams, booms at us in waking hours from newspaper headlines.","Newspapers which undertake to lead public sentiment generally fall into a ditch.","Newspapers always excite curiosity. No one ever lays one down without a feeling of disappointment."]
